Various user scrips I've modified to work the way I want to
Credit will be given to where I get them, and I will also list what changes I made

## Amazon URL Cleaner
### Install link: [here](https://github.com/Artemis6425/Artemis-User-Scripts/raw/refs/heads/main/scripts/Amazon%20URL%20Cleaner.user.js)
### Description
This fixes the Amazon URL to remove all that tracking garbage so you can share a short link.
### Changes
- Updated to use https rather than http
- Updated to only run at the end of page load, to make sure to get rid of any remaining tracking garbage that happens right at the end
